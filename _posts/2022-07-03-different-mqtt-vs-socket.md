# What is mqtt?
MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. MQTT is a simple messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices with low bandwidth. So, itâ€™s the perfect solution to exchange data between multiple IoT devices.

## Features
2. MQTT clients are very small, require minimal resources so can be used on small microcontrollers.
3. It is publish-subscribe, machine to machine network protocol.
4. MQTT message headers are small to optimize network bandwidth.
5. It allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. This makes for easy broadcasting messages to groups of things.
6. It is good for connecting with millions of IoT devices.
7. It is message based unlike socket (session based)
8. (QoS) Quality of service. It defines priority for data flow

## Publish-Subscribe Architecture

### Note
1. MQTT Client -> MQTT Broker (Publish)
2. MQTT Broker -> Other MQTT Clients (Publish)
3. MQTT Clients <- MQTT Broker (Subscribe)

## So when we do not need to use Mqtt
1. Large data communication
2. Authentication
3. Browser support
4. Chat system

### Note
For browser support, we need web-socket

# Conclusion
Let's use Mqtt in proper place
