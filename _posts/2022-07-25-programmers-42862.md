# Question
[Link](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/42862/solution_groups?language=javascript)

# Solution
It's greedy algorithm

## Steps
1. Create Array. The size is n
2. Initialize array to 1 (assume all students have a cloth first)
3. Decrease student cloth count who does not bring
4. Add student cloth count who bring one more
5. Borrow the cloth from student

# code
## My Solution
```javascript
function solution(n, lost, reserve) {
  var answer = 0;
  // Assume all students have a cloth
  const students = new Array(n).fill(1);

  // Decrase 1 to lost students
  for(let i = 0; i < lost.length; i++) {
    students[lost[i] - 1]--;
  }

  // Add 1 to reserved students
  for(let i = 0; i < reserve.length; i++) {
    students[reserve[i] - 1]++;
  }

  // Brrow the cloth
  for(let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
    if(students[i] === 0) {
      if(i !== 0 && students[i - 1] >= 2) {
        // Add student cloth count
        students[i]++;
        // Decrease stduent who rent count
        students[i - 1]--;
      } else if(i !== n - 1 && students[i + 1] >= 2) {
        // Add student cloth count
        students[i]++;
        // Decrease stduent who rent count
        students[i + 1]--;
      }
    }
  }

  // Filter students having a cloth
  answer = students.filter(student => student > 0).length;

  return answer;
}
```
### Note
- Only borrow when the student does not have any clothes

## Others solution
```javascript
function solution(n, lost, reserve) {
  // Substract all students to lost students
  return n - lost.filter(a => {
    // Find the reserve student near lost student
    const b = reserve.find(r => Math.abs(r - a) <= 1)
    if(!b) return true
    // Remove found serve student in reserve
    reserve = reserve.filter(r => r !== b)
  }).length
}
```
