# Question
[Link](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/12906)

# Solution
Check the numbers in a row

## Steps
1. Create array containing numbers 0 to 9
2. Loop the array
3. Check numbers includes number
4. If it's included, add it to total

# code
## My Solution
```javascript
function solution(numbers) {
  let answer = -1
  // Total
  let total = 0

  // Array containing numbers 0 to 9
  const oneToNine = [...Array(10).keys()]

  oneToNine.forEach(el => {
    if (!numbers.includes(el)) {
      total += el
    }
  })

  if (total > 0) {
    answer = total
  }

  return answer
}
```
- total variables can be ignored. It's possible to use answer directly

## Others solution
```javascript
function solution(numbers) {
  return 45 - numbers.reduce((cur, acc) => cur + acc, 0)
}
```
- 45 is sum of 0 to 9
